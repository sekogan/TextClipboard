# TextClipboard

Clears the formatting of any text that is currently on the clipboard. Works silently in the background.

Features:

- super simple (no keyboard shortcuts, no UI, no tray icon);
- super lightweight (one executable, ~9KB);
- no dependencies;
- portable;
- secure: anyone can verify the code;
- runs on Windows 10.

## Installation

Unpack the 64-bit or 32-bit archive to a folder and run the following command. The command doesn't need UAC elevation.

```
install.cmd
```

## Uninstallation

Run

```
uninstall.cmd
```

from the installation folder. Again, UAC elevation is not required.
